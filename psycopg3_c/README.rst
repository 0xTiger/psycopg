PostgreSQL database adapter for Python - optimisation package
=============================================================

This distribution contains the optional optimization package ``psycopg3_c``.

Installation::

    pip install psycopg3-c

Installing this distribution requires the ``libpq-dev`` package and other
packages normally used to build Python C extensions. If you cannot meet these
dependencies, don't worry: you don't need the package: please install the
``psycopg3`` package only.

Please read `the project readme`__ for more details.
